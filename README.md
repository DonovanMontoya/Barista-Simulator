# Barista-Simulator
*Donovan Montoya's GIMM Final Individual Game Repository*

My game is a VR barista Simulator where the customers ask for what they want without any specific coffee names, just the flavors or textures they want,
forcing the player to experiment with coffee drinks and helps them learn more about coffee.

The Core Game Loop of my game (Barista Sim), in its simplest form, will be to:
1. load level (See customers you will deal with during shift)
2. Fulfill Orders.
3. Earn Points (Money) based on correct orders.
